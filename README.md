## Project Abstract

### Title: **aLIVE**

### Description:

aLIVE is a web-based application that allows patients to inform their assigned doctor about their own medical information (i.e, heart rate, blood pressure, blood glicemia, oxygen level, body temperature).
The connection between patients (even in elderly care homes) and doctors will be simplified - the patients themselves, or the caregivers, can update their profile information (such as medical conditions, weight and height) by inputting the specific values onto the platform.
Each patient can have multiple sensors tracking their health data and his doctor is notified when some value is dangerous.
